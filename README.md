# Todo Web App

This project is a simple Todo web application built using [Python Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) for the backend and [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML), [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS), and [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) for the frontend.

## 🚀 Features

- **Todo Management**: Add, delete and update tasks.
- **Status Tracking**: Mark tasks as update/delete.
- **User Authentication**: Register, login, and logout functionality(coming soon).
- **Data Persistence**: Tasks are stored in a database (SQLAlchemy).
